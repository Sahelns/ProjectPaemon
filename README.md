## 🌈 About Project Pæmon

Welcome to **Project Pæmon**, a Pokémon-inspired experience that curates a unique companion—your very own Pæmon! This project is a collaborative labor of love by four developers from around the world:

- **Phil** 🖥️ [LinkedIn](#)
- **Sama** 💡 [LinkedIn](#)
- **Hannah** 🎨 [LinkedIn](#)
- **Chan** 🛠️ [LinkedIn](#)

Despite different time zones, backgrounds, and skill sets, we came together to create a playful, AI-powered project that celebrates individuality. **Project Pæmon** takes your unique qualities and username, analyzes them through an engaging questionnaire, and generates a one-of-a-kind Pæmon just for you.

## 🎮 Key Features

- **Personalized Pæmon Generation:** Your answers shape the name, type, stats, and backstory of your Pæmon.
- **AI-Powered Descriptions:** OpenAI (GPT-3.5) creates unique backstories, flavor texts, and abilities for your Pæmon.
- **Custom Pixel Art:** Stable Diffusion generates GameBoy Advance-style pixel sprites.
- **Dynamic Background Music:** Beatoven.ai composes a chill, nostalgic soundtrack, enhanced with MagicLoops.
- **Screenshot Option:** Save your unique Pæmon card as an image to share with your friends!
